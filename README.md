# Simple Service Worker Example

The code in this repository is based on the
[Service Workers Break the Browser’s Refresh Button by Default; Here’s Why](https://redfin.engineering/service-workers-break-the-browsers-refresh-button-by-default-here-s-why-56f9417694)
and
[How to Fix the Refresh Button When Using Service Workers](https://redfin.engineering/how-to-fix-the-refresh-button-when-using-service-workers-a8e27af6df68)
articles.

Use `serve` to serve the website during test/debug
(`yarn add global serve`).

Did not get this code working as speced in the article.
Will have to come back to it.
